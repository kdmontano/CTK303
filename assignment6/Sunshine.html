    <p class="text-success">This is Sunshine, my cat. She's an orange, long hair tabby. She just turned 10 in Decemner, so she's a geriatric now. She looks super cute in this photo, but her looks are very deceiving. Sunshine is very fiesty and is quick to show her discomfort through mild violence. This photo was taken after I took her toy - which I had the intention of trying to play with using it - and she automatically went into play-attack mode. </p>

    <p class="text-warning">This is Sunshine resting in her beloved basket. I put one of her beds in it to make it comfier and she sleeps there everynight if she's not already sleeping on my bed. She looks so refined and elegant, with her little paws crossed like that! She is a bit clumsy though, as she will sometimes knock over the basket trying to get in or out of it. This has woken me up some nights because she will meow at me until I fix it.</p>

    <p class="text-info">Sunshine is a professional baker. Here, you can observe how she demonstrates her perfect "loaf." This is, of course, after she throughly kneads the blankets to perfection before she moves on to sitting in this position! </p>

    <p class="text-primary">Sunshine is a very silly kitty! She doesn't keep still for many glamor shots, so most of the "nice" pictures I have of her is when she is sleepy and resting. Though, sometimes I am able to capture goofy angles of her, while she follow my phone in my attempts to capture her radiance.</p>
